.SH NAME
miredo-server \- Teredo server for Unix
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "miredo-server" " [" "-c config_file" "] [" "-f" "] [" "-u user" "]"
.RB "[" "server_name" "]"

.SH DESCRIPTON
.B Miredo-server
is an Unix daemon program which implements a Teredo server as specified
by the "Teredo: Tunneling IPv6 over UDP through NATs" Internet proposed
standard (RFC 4380).

A Teredo server is required for Teredo clients to setup their IPv6
connectivity through Teredo. A Teredo server must have two global
static subsequent IPv4 addresses. It receives packets from Teredo
clients and Teredo relays on UDP port 3544.

.SH OPTIONS

Specify an alternate configuration file for Miredo instead of the
.RI "default, " "@confdir@/miredo-server.conf" "."

.TP
.BR "\-f" " or " "\-\-foreground"
Do not detach from the console. Run the program in the foreground.

.TP

.\".SH DIAGNOSTICS

.IR "setuid" " (see option " "-u" "), so as to decrease the system's"
exposure to potential security issues.

.SH SIGNALS
.BR "SIGHUP" " Force a reload of the daemon."

.BR "SIGINT" ", " "SIGTERM" " Shutdown the daemon."
